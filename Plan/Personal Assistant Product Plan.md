# Product Plan: Local and Privacy-Focused Personal Assistant

## 1. Introduction

The increasing reliance on digital assistants has highlighted a growing user demand for solutions that prioritize privacy and offer greater control over personal data. [cite: 236] This product plan outlines the development of a personal assistant application designed to operate primarily locally, offering a secure and private experience for both everyday users and those with more advanced technical requirements. [cite: 237]

This application will distinguish itself by supporting both locally hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) and web API-based LLMs, providing flexibility while ensuring sensitive user data remains under their control. [cite: 238] Unlike conventional chat-based assistants, this program will remember past interactions through intelligent summarization, minimizing the need for extensive context windows in the LLMs and optimizing resource usage. [cite: 238] A fundamental aspect of this project is its commitment to open-source principles, fostering community involvement and enhancing transparency in its operation. [cite: 239]

The primary objectives are to empower users with an efficient productivity tool, deliver an AI assistant experience that respects user privacy and data security, and cultivate a collaborative environment for ongoing development and innovation through its open-source nature. [cite: 240]

The selection of a local operation model with support for local LLMs directly responds to a rising concern among users regarding the privacy implications of cloud-based AI services. [cite: 241] Research indicates a significant interest in offline AI solutions that ensure data security by keeping interactions on the user's device. [cite: 242] This application aims to capitalize on this demand by offering a robust, locally focused alternative. [cite: 242]

Furthermore, the decision to support both local and web-based LLMs acknowledges the diverse needs and capabilities of users. [cite: 243, 244] While local LLMs offer enhanced privacy and offline functionality, web-based LLMs often provide access to more advanced models and potentially better performance for certain tasks. [cite: 244] This dual support introduces a layer of complexity in managing different LLM interfaces and ensuring a cohesive user experience, but it ultimately provides users with greater choice and adaptability. [cite: 245]

## 2. Competitive Landscape and Feature Analysis

The market for personal assistant applications includes a variety of solutions, ranging from fully local to entirely cloud-based, with some hybrid approaches emerging. [cite: 246] Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing offerings is crucial for positioning our application effectively. [cite: 247]

### 2.1 Existing Personal Assistant Applications

#### 2.1.1 Local Assistants

Several initiatives focus on providing personal assistant functionality that operates locally. [cite: 248]

Local AI Assistant (LocalGPT), available on the Microsoft Store, is an example of an advanced offline chatbot designed for Windows. [cite: 249, 250] It leverages the Microsoft Phi-3 model to deliver AI-powered conversations and assistance without requiring an internet connection. [cite: 250] Key features include full offline functionality, ensuring complete privacy and data security by processing all interactions locally. [cite: 250] It offers advanced natural language understanding, context retention within conversations, high-quality text generation, and task-specific assistance such as text summarization and idea brainstorming. [cite: 251] The application also supports loading custom datasets for a more tailored experience and does not require an account or login, further emphasizing data privacy. [cite: 252]

Another notable open-source project is Leon, which is designed to live on a user's server, offering automation of virtual life and acting as a "virtual brain". [cite: 253] Leon is built on a modular architecture, allowing for flexible creation or use of skills tailored to individual needs. [cite: 253, 254, 255] It is powered by AI concepts like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Speech-to-Text (STT). [cite: 254, 255] Leon supports both cloud-based and offline TTS and STT solutions, giving users control over their privacy. [cite: 255, 256, 257] The project emphasizes its open-source nature, encouraging community contributions to expand its capabilities. [cite: 256, 257]

The approach taken by Local AI Assistant, focusing on a specific, readily available model like Phi-3, offers ease of use for individuals seeking immediate offline AI capabilities. [cite: 257] In contrast, Leon's modularity and open-source nature cater to users who desire greater customization and control over their personal assistant. [cite: 257] Our proposed application should strive for a balance between these two approaches, offering an intuitive experience for daily users while providing the flexibility and control that power users demand in terms of model selection and extensibility. [cite: 257]

#### 2.1.2 Cloud-Based Assistants

The market is dominated by cloud-based intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri. [cite: 258, 259, 260] These assistants typically answer questions and perform actions based on natural language voice commands and location awareness. [cite: 258, 259, 260]

Amazon Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, is accessible through various Amazon devices like the Echo line of speakers. [cite: 259] It allows users to create to-do lists, play music, order products from Amazon, and control compatible smart home devices. [cite: 259] Google Assistant, available on Android devices and Google Home speakers, offers similar functionalities, including voice search, personalized tips, smart home control, and integration with various Google services. [cite: 259] Apple Siri, deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem, performs tasks, retrieves information, and controls Apple devices through voice recognition and natural language processing. [cite: 259] Microsoft also offers Copilot, a chatbot integrated into Microsoft Bing and Edge, capable of summarizing documents and creating images. [cite: 259, 260]

Beyond these major players, other cloud-based assistants like Oracle Digital Assistant, IBM watsonx Assistant, and Lindy offer more specialized features, often geared towards business applications. [cite: 260, 261] These platforms provide functionalities such as automating workflows, generating content, and offering personalized assistance, often integrating with various business tools and applications. [cite: 260, 261]

A common thread among these cloud-based assistants is their reliance on continuous internet connectivity and the storage of user data on remote servers. [cite: 261] While they offer a wide array of features and seamless integration with various services, their fundamental architecture raises privacy concerns for users who prefer their data to remain local. [cite: 261] This privacy gap presents a significant opportunity for our proposed local-first application. [cite: 261]

#### 2.1.3 Hybrid Approaches

Some applications attempt to bridge the gap between local operation and cloud-based AI. [cite: 262, 263, 264, 265]

Braina, for example, respects user privacy by storing most data locally on the user's system while also allowing interaction with both local and cloud AI models. [cite: 263, 264] This approach aligns with the privacy-centric goals of our project and suggests a viable model for integrating cloud-based LLMs in a way that minimizes privacy risks. [cite: 263, 264] Braina offers features like voice typing with dictation, the ability to chat with PDFs and webpages, and wireless control of the PC via Android or iOS devices. [cite: 264] The decision to store the majority of user data locally while providing options for cloud-based AI interaction indicates a recognition of the user's desire for privacy without completely sacrificing the benefits of advanced cloud-based models. [cite: 264, 265] This hybrid model offers a potential blueprint for our application's approach to balancing local control with access to powerful web LLMs. [cite: 265]

### 2.2 Target User Groups

The user query explicitly mentions catering to both daily users and power users. [cite: 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271] Understanding the distinct needs of these two groups is essential for designing an application that effectively serves both. [cite: 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271]

Daily users typically seek ease of use, reliability, and quick access to common functionalities. [cite: 268, 269] They would likely appreciate a simple and intuitive interface that allows them to perform tasks like web searches, application installation, and basic file management without requiring deep technical knowledge. [cite: 268, 269] Features like voice control could further enhance usability for this group. [cite: 269]

Power users, on the other hand, often demand more advanced control and customization options. [cite: 269, 270] They would likely value the ability to select and configure both local and web-based LLMs, leverage the "tools" system for scripting and automation of complex tasks, and have granular control over memory management and application behavior. [cite: 269, 270] Access to system-level tools and information, along with the ability to customize the user interface, would also appeal to this group. [cite: 270]

The application's design should be scalable, allowing for the progressive disclosure of advanced features to avoid overwhelming daily users while still providing the depth of functionality that power users require. [cite: 271]

### 2.3 Feature Benchmarking

To better understand the competitive landscape and highlight the unique value proposition of our proposed application, a comparison of key features across different types of personal assistants is presented in the table below: [cite: 272, 273, 274, 275, 276]

| Feature | Local AI Assistant | Leon | Amazon Alexa | Google Assistant | Our Application (Proposed) |

| Tools System | No | Yes (Skills) 1 | Yes (Skills) | Yes (Actions) | Yes |

This table illustrates that while some local assistants exist, they may lack the breadth of features or the flexibility in LLM support that our application aims to provide. [cite: 274, 275, 276] Cloud-based assistants offer extensive functionalities but fall short on privacy. [cite: 275, 276] Our proposed solution seeks to combine the privacy and offline capabilities of local assistants with the versatility of web LLMs, all within an open-source framework and with a focus on catering to both daily and power users through a comprehensive feature set. [cite: 276]

## 3. Core Functionalities and User Experience

The application will offer a range of functionalities tailored to meet the needs of both daily and power users, with a strong emphasis on a user-friendly experience and robust privacy controls. [cite: 277, 278, 279, 280, 281]

### 3.1 Features for Daily Users

For individuals seeking a reliable and straightforward assistant for everyday tasks, the application will provide intuitive features for common needs. [cite: 278, 279, 280, 281] This includes simple web information lookup, allowing users to ask questions or search for information on the web in a manner similar to using a search engine. [cite: 279] The application will also provide easy access to news and other timely information, potentially through integrated feeds or web scraping capabilities. [cite: 279] A key feature will be the ability to discover and install new applications directly through the assistant, streamlining the process of finding and setting up software. [cite: 279] For basic utility, the application will include everyday tools such as a calculator and a function to quickly retrieve the current date and time. [cite: 279, 280, 281] Furthermore, daily users will benefit from simplified file management capabilities, allowing them to easily find, move, group, and rearrange files and photos on their local system. [cite: 280, 281] The user interface for these features will be designed to be highly accessible, requiring minimal technical expertise. [cite: 280, 281]

Consideration will be given to incorporating voice control functionalities, leveraging local LLMs for speech recognition if feasible, to further enhance ease of use and provide a hands-free interaction option. [cite: 281]

### 3.2 Features for Power Users

Users with more advanced technical skills and specific needs will find a suite of features designed for greater control and extensibility. [cite: 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287] This includes the ability to precisely select and configure both local and web API-based LLMs, allowing them to tailor the assistant's AI capabilities to their preferences and hardware limitations. [cite: 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287] A powerful "tools" system will enable power users to create and utilize scripts and automation workflows for complex tasks, extending the application's functionality beyond its core features. [cite: 283, 284, 285, 286, 287] They will also have detailed control over the parameters governing memory summarization and the retrieval of past conversation summaries, allowing for fine-tuning of how the application remembers and utilizes previous interactions. [cite: 284, 285, 286, 287] Access to system-level tools and information, implemented with appropriate security safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, will provide power users with deeper integration into their computing environment. [cite: 285, 286, 287] Finally, the application will offer options for customizing the user interface and the behavior of the clients (GUI, web, CLI/TUI) to suit individual workflows and preferences. [cite: 286, 287] This level of granular control and extensibility will empower power users to adapt the assistant to their specific and often evolving needs. [cite: 287]

### 3.3 Non-Chat Interaction Model

The application will employ a novel approach to remembering conversations by summarizing past interactions rather than maintaining a traditional, turn-by-turn chat history. [cite: 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293] This method offers several advantages, particularly in mitigating the limitations imposed by the context window sizes of LLMs. [cite: 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293] By summarizing previous exchanges, the amount of information that needs to be included in the prompt for subsequent requests is significantly reduced, leading to more efficient processing and potentially lower computational costs. [cite: 289, 290, 291, 292, 293] Furthermore, this approach can lead to more effective memory usage, as the key points and outcomes of past conversations are distilled into concise summaries. [cite: 290, 291, 292, 293] Users will be able to access and manage these summaries, potentially through the integration with Qdrant, allowing them to review past interactions and provide context for new requests. [cite: 291, 292, 293] This non-chat interaction model requires a robust and intelligent summarization mechanism that can accurately capture the essence of conversations. [cite: 292, 293] It also necessitates a user-friendly interface for navigating and utilizing these summaries to ensure that users can effectively recall and build upon previous interactions. [cite: 293]

## 4. Local and Web LLM Integration

A key aspect of the application's design is its ability to seamlessly integrate both local and web API-based Large Language Models, providing users with flexibility and choice. [cite: 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

### 4.1 Integrating Local LLMs

Integrating local LLMs directly onto the user's machine offers significant benefits in terms of privacy and the ability to use the assistant offline. [cite: 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] Several approaches can be employed for this integration. [cite: 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

Frameworks like Ollama and LM Studio simplify the process of managing and running local LLMs. [cite: 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] Ollama, for instance, allows users to easily download and run open-source LLMs like Llama 2 and Mistral locally, managing model weights, configurations, and datasets in a unified package. [cite: 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] LM Studio provides a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with LLMs and includes a model library for easy discovery and installation. [cite: 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] The application will aim to support one or both of these frameworks to streamline the user experience of utilizing local LLMs. [cite: 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

However, it is important to consider the hardware requirements for running these models. [cite: 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] Larger LLMs can demand significant computational resources, including a powerful GPU, ample RAM (potentially 16GB or more for smaller models, and 64GB or more for larger ones), and sufficient storage space (ranging from 50GB to 300GB+ depending on the model). [cite: 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] While local LLMs offer privacy and offline capabilities, users may face challenges with initial setup, resource intensity, and the availability of specific models in a local format. [cite: 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] Providing clear, step-by-step instructions and potentially automating the setup process for popular local LLM frameworks will be crucial for broader user adoption, especially among those who are less technically inclined. [cite: 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

### 4.2 Integrating Web API-Based LLMs

The application will also support integration with various web API-based LLM providers, such as OpenAI and Google, allowing users to leverage their advanced models. [cite: 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] This integration will be facilitated through our servers, as mandated by the privacy requirements to ensure that user-provided API keys are not directly exposed to the client. [cite: 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] This server-mediated approach will involve the client sending requests to our secure servers, which will then forward these requests to the user's chosen web LLM using our managed API keys. [cite: 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] The response from the web LLM will then be relayed back to the client. [cite: 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

This method offers the benefit of accessing state-of-the-art LLMs and potentially achieving better performance for certain complex tasks. [cite: 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] However, it introduces a dependency on internet connectivity and incurs costs associated with API usage, which may vary depending on the provider and the volume of requests. [cite: 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] While our server-mediated approach aims to enhance privacy by managing API keys and potentially anonymizing requests, users should be aware of the inherent privacy considerations when interacting with cloud-based services. [cite: 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] The design of this server component must prioritize security to protect API keys and ensure the integrity of the communication channel. [cite: 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] Careful optimization will also be necessary to minimize any latency introduced by this intermediary layer. [cite: 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

### 4.3 Self-Managed Context Implementation

To overcome the inherent limitations of LLM context windows, the application will implement a self-managed context strategy. [cite: 304, 305, 306, 307, 308] This means the application itself will be responsible for maintaining the relevant context for each user prompt, rather than relying solely on the LLM's internal memory. [cite: 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]

Before sending a user's query to the chosen LLM, the application will determine and append relevant historical information, such as summaries of previous conversations, user preferences, and any other contextual data pertinent to the current request. [cite: 305, 306, 307, 308] Techniques like sophisticated prompt engineering will be employed to inform the LLM about its role, the current status of the conversation, and the provided contextual information, in addition to the user's specific prompt. [cite: 305, 306, 307, 308] Crucially, each request sent to the LLM will have a clean context, with the application explicitly providing all necessary information for that specific interaction. [cite: 305, 306, 307, 308] This approach requires intelligent mechanisms within the application to identify and retrieve the most relevant contextual data from its local storage (potentially utilizing Qdrant). [cite: 306, 307, 308] It also necessitates careful formatting of the prompt to ensure the LLM can effectively utilize the provided context without being overwhelmed. [cite: 306, 307, 308]

This self-managed context strategy is vital for maintaining a coherent and personalized user experience over extended interactions without being constrained by the LLM's context window limitations. [cite: 308]

## 5. Privacy and Anonymity Framework

Ensuring the privacy and anonymity of user data is a paramount concern for this application. [cite: 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] The framework for achieving this encompasses several key strategies. [cite: 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

### 5.1 Server-Mediated API Requests

As previously mentioned, when users opt to utilize web API-based LLMs, all communication will be mediated through our secure servers. [cite: 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] This architecture is designed to prevent the client application from directly handling sensitive API keys provided by the user for accessing services like OpenAI or Google Cloud. [cite: 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

Instead, the client will send the user's query to our servers, which will then securely manage the API keys and forward the request to the appropriate LLM service. [cite: 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] The response will then be relayed back to the client. [cite: 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

This intermediary step ensures that user API keys are protected and not directly exposed to potential interception on the client-side. [cite: 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

Furthermore, this server-mediated approach opens possibilities for enhancing anonymity. [cite: 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] We can explore techniques to anonymize the requests originating from the client before they are forwarded to the web LLM. [cite: 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] This could involve stripping identifying information or using proxy services to mask the user's IP address. [cite: 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] The communication between the client and our servers will also need to be secured. [cite: 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] We will investigate various options for establishing anonymous or pseudo-anonymous communication channels. [cite: 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] This might include the use of temporary, session-based tokens or request signing mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of requests without requiring persistent user identification. [cite: 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

The implementation of this server-mediated architecture will require careful design and rigorous security testing to ensure its effectiveness in protecting user privacy. [cite: 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

### 5.2 Local Data Storage and Optional Cloud Backup

By default, all user data, including previous conversation summaries and application settings, will be stored locally on the user's device. [cite: 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] This ensures that sensitive information does not automatically reside on remote servers, giving users direct control over their data. [cite: 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

Recognizing the need for data redundancy and accessibility across devices, the application will offer an optional, user-initiated cloud backup feature. [cite: 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] Users will have the choice to encrypt their local data and securely back it up to a cloud storage service of their preference or one provided by us. [cite: 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] The implementation of both local and cloud storage will prioritize robust encryption methods to protect data at rest and in transit. [cite: 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330] Users will be provided with clear information about the security measures in place and will have control over enabling or disabling cloud backup as well as managing their local data. [cite: 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]

This dual approach to data storage aims to provide both privacy through local storage and convenience through optional cloud backup, all while maintaining a strong focus on data security.

### 5.3 Sensitive Data Handling

Beyond the architectural choices for data storage and API interaction, the application will adhere to the principle of minimizing the handling of sensitive data wherever possible. [cite: 90]

Even with the server-mediated approach for web LLMs, we aim to reduce the amount of user input that our servers need to process or store. [cite: 91]

We will explore strategies for anonymizing or redacting potentially sensitive information within the client application before it is sent to our servers. [cite: 92]

This could involve techniques like identifying and masking personal details or financial information in the user's prompts. [cite: 93]

Furthermore, we will carefully review the data retention policies for our servers, ensuring that any temporary processing of user data is kept to a minimum and that logs are handled in a way that respects user privacy. [cite: 94]

The goal is to create a system where the exposure of sensitive user data is inherently limited at every stage of the interaction, thereby minimizing the risk of potential leaks or breaches. [cite: 95]

## 6. Open-Source Strategy and Licensing

A core tenet of this project is its commitment to being open-source, with only carefully considered exceptions.1 This decision is driven by the desire to build and maintain user trust through transparency and to foster a collaborative environment for development and improvement. [cite: 96]

### 6.1 Open-Source Commitment

Making the application open-source offers numerous benefits. It allows the community to inspect the codebase, verify its security and privacy claims, and contribute to its ongoing development.1 This transparency is particularly important for a privacy-focused application, as it enables users and security experts to audit the software and ensure it operates as intended. [cite: 97, 98, 99]

The open-source nature also encourages community-driven innovation, with developers able to contribute new features, bug fixes, and optimizations, leading to a more robust and feature-rich application over time. [cite: 98, 99] This collaborative approach can accelerate development and ensure the application remains relevant and adapts to the evolving needs of its users. [cite: 99]

### 6.2 Licensing Options

Choosing the right open-source license is crucial for defining how the project can be used and contributed to. [cite: 100]

Permissive licenses like the MIT License and the Apache License 2.0 are strong candidates.70 The MIT license, for example, allows for broad freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software, even in proprietary applications. [cite: 101, 102, 103, 104] The Apache 2.0 license similarly offers significant freedom but also includes provisions related to patent rights, which can be beneficial for larger projects. [cite: 102, 103, 104]

We will carefully evaluate the implications of different licenses to select one that balances permissiveness for users and developers with appropriate protections for the project and its contributors. [cite: 103, 104]

The chosen license will be clearly communicated to the community. [cite: 104]

### 6.3 Closed-Source Exceptions

While the primary goal is to be open-source, there might be specific components or integrations where closed-source exceptions are necessary. [cite: 105, 106, 107, 108, 109]

This could arise due to dependencies on proprietary libraries with restrictive licenses or the need to protect specific intellectual property. [cite: 106, 107, 108, 109]

Any such exceptions will be carefully considered and will be kept to an absolute minimum. [cite: 107, 108, 109] The criteria for determining these exceptions will be transparently communicated to the user community, along with clear explanations of why a particular component needs to be closed-source. [cite: 108, 109]

We will strive to ensure that the core functionality and the aspects related to user privacy remain open and auditable. [cite: 109]

## 7. Self-Managed Context and Memory Implementation

The application's ability to remember and utilize past interactions effectively without relying on traditional chat history will be achieved through a combination of Qdrant for memory storage and intelligent information recognition. [cite: 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]

### 7.1 Qdrant Integration

Qdrant, a vector database, will serve as the primary storage mechanism for conversation summaries and user preferences.51 When a conversation occurs, the application will generate a concise summary of the key topics, decisions, and outcomes. [cite: 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]

This summary, along with relevant metadata such as timestamps and participants, will be stored as a vector embedding in Qdrant. [cite: 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]

User preferences, such as preferred response lengths, communication styles, and frequently used tools, will also be stored as vector embeddings. [cite: 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]

This vector representation allows for efficient semantic search and retrieval of relevant past interactions and preferences. [cite: 114, 115, 116, 117]

When a new user prompt is received, the application will query Qdrant using the embedding of the current prompt to find semantically similar conversation summaries and user preferences. [cite: 115, 116, 117]

The most relevant information retrieved from Qdrant will then be incorporated into the context provided to the LLM for the current request. [cite: 116, 117]

This approach leverages Qdrant's capabilities for fast and efficient retrieval of contextually relevant information, enabling the LLM to have access to the necessary history without the overhead of a full chat log. [cite: 117]

### 7.2 Recognizing Key Information

To enhance the personalization and long-term usefulness of the assistant, the application will employ mechanisms to recognize and extract key information from user interactions.1 This could involve using a local LLM to analyze conversation summaries and identify recurring themes, important entities (like names or projects), and user preferences. [cite: 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123]

For example, if a user frequently asks for short, concise responses, this preference will be noted and stored. [cite: 119, 120, 121, 122, 123]

Similarly, if certain topics or projects are discussed repeatedly, these will be recognized as key conversations for later retrieval. [cite: 120, 121, 122, 123]

This extracted information will be stored in Qdrant, linked to the user's profile. [cite: 121, 122, 123]

When formulating prompts for the LLM, the application will consider these recognized key elements, ensuring that relevant preferences and historical context are included even if they were not part of the immediate past conversation. [cite: 122, 123]

This intelligent recognition and storage of key information will allow the assistant to learn from user interactions over time, providing a more tailored and effective experience. [cite: 123]

## 8. "Tools" System Architecture and Extensibility

To extend the capabilities of the LLM beyond its inherent knowledge, the application will feature a robust and extensible "tools" system. [cite: 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]

### 8.1 Tool Integration

The "tools" system will be designed with a plugin-based architecture, allowing developers to easily add new functionalities to the application.54 Each tool will be a self-contained module responsible for a specific task, such as performing a web search, installing an application, managing files, or accessing information from Qdrant. [cite: 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]

For web searching, the application could integrate with existing search engine APIs or utilize libraries for web scraping. [cite: 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]

Application installation will likely involve platform-specific package managers (e.g., apt on Linux, brew on macOS, winget on Windows). [cite: 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]

File system operations will be implemented using the operating system's native APIs. A built-in calculator tool will handle mathematical computations. [cite: 128, 129, 130, 131]

Tools will also be developed to query Qdrant for relevant historical chats and user preferences. [cite: 129, 130, 131]

This modular design will make it easier to develop, test, and maintain individual tools, as well as allow the community to contribute new tools to expand the application's functionality. [cite: 130, 131]

Security will be a paramount concern, especially for tools that interact with the user's system, and appropriate permission models will be implemented to ensure user control over tool execution. [cite: 131]

### 8.2 LLM Interaction with Tools

When the LLM requires information or needs to perform an action that falls outside its core capabilities, it will be able to request the use of specific tools.77 If the necessary information is not directly provided in the user's prompt, the LLM will be designed to recognize the need for a particular tool and formulate a request for it. [cite: 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137]

For example, if a user asks for the current weather in a specific location, and the LLM does not have this real-time data, it will request the "weather" tool, potentially providing the location as a parameter. [cite: 133, 134, 135, 136, 137]

The application will then execute the "weather" tool, retrieve the information, and provide the output back to the LLM. [cite: 134, 135, 136, 137]

The LLM can then use this information to formulate a response to the user. [cite: 135, 136, 137]

The communication between the LLM and the tools will ideally utilize structured output formats, such as JSON, to ensure clear and unambiguous exchange of information.77 This will allow the LLM to reliably provide the necessary inputs to the tools and correctly interpret the results they return. [cite: 136, 137]

This seamless interaction between the LLM and the tools will significantly enhance the assistant's ability to perform a wide range of dynamic and real-world tasks. [cite: 137]

## 9. Technical Implementation Details (Rust Specifics)

The application will be developed using the Rust programming language, adhering to specific technical requirements outlined in the user query. [cite: 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

### 9.1 Rust 2024 Edition and async-std

The project will utilize the Rust 2024 edition, ensuring access to the latest language features and improvements. [cite: 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

For asynchronous operations, the async-std runtime will be employed.82 While the Rust ecosystem has a strong presence of Tokio for asynchronous programming, the explicit requirement for async-std necessitates careful consideration of library compatibility. [cite: 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

We will leverage best practices for using async-std to achieve high performance and concurrency, utilizing the async/await syntax for managing non-blocking operations and ensuring the application remains responsive.82 [cite: 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

### 9.2 Error Handling with thiserror

Error handling will be implemented using the thiserror crate.73 This crate simplifies the creation of custom error types using Rust enums. [cite: 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

The project will define a global Result type in its prelude, and individual modules will implement their own error enums. [cite: 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

These module-specific error types will then be integrated into the project's global error enum, providing a consistent and well-structured approach to error management throughout the application. [cite: 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]

This will enhance the robustness and maintainability of the codebase. [cite: 144, 145, 146, 147]

### 9.3 Modular Code and Traits

The codebase will be organized into smaller, more specific modules, each focused on a particular aspect of the application's functionality. [cite: 145, 146, 147]

Traits will be extensively used to reduce code duplication and to group together related functionalities.85 When a trait has multiple implementations, these implementations will be organized within dedicated sub-modules or separate files within a module, promoting clarity and maintainability. [cite: 146, 147]

This modular and trait-based architecture will improve code organization, reusability, and testability. [cite: 147]

### 9.4 Minimizing Code Nesting

Efforts will be made to minimize code nesting, aiming for a maximum depth of 2-3 levels wherever possible. [cite: 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]

This will improve code readability and reduce cognitive complexity. [cite: 149, 150, 151, 152] Strategies such as using helper functions, early returns, and structuring code logically will be employed to achieve this goal. [cite: 149, 150, 151, 152]

### 9.5 Logging with tracing and tracing-subscriber

Instead of the standard logging crate, the application will utilize the tracing and tracing-subscriber crates for logging and instrumentation. [cite: 150, 151, 152]

tracing provides a flexible framework for emitting structured log messages, while tracing-subscriber allows for configuring how these messages are collected, filtered, and displayed. [cite: 151, 152]

This choice offers a more powerful and versatile approach to monitoring and debugging the application's behavior. [cite: 152]

### 9.6 Concision and Rust Conventions

The codebase will adhere to standard Rust conventions, ensuring readability and maintainability for developers familiar with the language. [cite: 153, 154, 155]

This includes the consistent use of match statements for control flow and the let Ok/Some =... pattern for handling Result and Option types. [cite: 154, 155]

Code will be written to be concise and idiomatic, following the established best practices of the Rust community. [cite: 155]

### 9.7 Asynchronous Operations

Asynchronous operations are fundamental to the application's performance goals. [cite: 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161]

The async-std runtime will be used to enable non-blocking execution of tasks, particularly for I/O-bound operations such as network requests and file system interactions. [cite: 157, 158, 159, 160, 161]

The async and await keywords will be used extensively to manage asynchronous code, ensuring that the application remains responsive even when performing potentially long-running tasks. [cite: 158, 159, 160, 161]

### 9.8 Internationalization

The application will support internationalization to cater to a global user base. [cite: 159, 160, 161]

We will explore suitable Rust libraries for this purpose, such as rust-i18n or i18nx.70 These libraries provide mechanisms for managing translations and localizing the user interface. [cite: 160, 161]

Strategies for handling different languages across the GUI, web, and CLI/TUI clients will be carefully considered to ensure a consistent experience for users regardless of their preferred language. [cite: 161]

## 10. Multi-Client Architecture and Development

The application will be designed to support multiple client interfaces: a graphical user interface (GUI), a web client, and a command-line interface (CLI) or text-based user interface (TUI). [cite: 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

### 10.1 Shared Core Logic

A primary architectural goal is to maximize the sharing of core application logic across all three client types. [cite: 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

This will reduce development effort, ensure consistency in functionality, and simplify maintenance. [cite: 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

The application will be structured to separate the underlying business logic and data handling from the presentation layer of each client. [cite: 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

This separation will allow the core Rust code to be reused across the GUI, web, and CLI/TUI clients, with each client providing its own user interface tailored to its specific platform and interaction paradigm. [cite: 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

### 10.2 GUI Client

For the graphical user interface, we will investigate suitable Rust GUI frameworks available in 2024.89 Options such as Slint, Iced, and others will be evaluated based on factors like cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux), ease of use, performance, and the availability of necessary UI components. [cite: 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

Slint, for example, is designed for creating native UIs with support for multiple languages and integration with Rust.89 Iced, inspired by the Elm architecture, offers a data-centered approach with strong support for asynchronous actions.90 The choice of GUI framework will be critical for providing a user-friendly and visually appealing experience for desktop users. [cite: 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

### 10.3 Web Client

The web client will allow users to access the personal assistant through a standard web browser. [cite: 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]

We will explore Rust web frameworks for building this client.71 Frameworks like Actix Web, Axum, and Rocket are known for their performance and reliability. [cite: 170, 171, 172, 173] Axum, built on top of Tokio, is designed for robustness and ergonomics.93 Rocket emphasizes simplicity and type safety.94 The web client will likely communicate with the core application logic via a set of RESTful APIs, allowing for a decoupled architecture where the backend handles the core functionalities and the frontend focuses on user interaction. [cite: 171, 172, 173]

### 10.4 CLI/TUI Client

For power users and those who prefer a terminal-based interface, a CLI or TUI client will be developed. [cite: 172, 173]

We will evaluate Rust TUI/CLI frameworks such as Ratatui and Iocraft.72 Ratatui, forked from tui-rs, provides a flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal.72 Iocraft offers a declarative style similar to React.73 A CLI/TUI client will offer a lightweight and efficient way to interact with the application, particularly for tasks that can be easily expressed through text commands. [cite: 173]

## 11. Performance and Scalability

Performance and scalability are key considerations for ensuring a positive user experience across all client types. [cite: 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]

### 11.1 Asynchronous Architecture

The asynchronous architecture, powered by async-std, will be fundamental to achieving high performance and responsiveness.82 By utilizing async/await, the application will be able to handle multiple concurrent tasks and I/O operations without blocking the main execution thread. [cite: 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]

This is particularly important for tasks like web searching, application installation, and interacting with LLM APIs, which can involve network latency. [cite: 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]

### 11.2 Resource Management

Efficient management of system resources, especially CPU and memory, will be crucial, particularly when running local LLMs which can be resource-intensive.33 We will explore techniques for optimizing LLM inference, such as quantization if supported by the chosen frameworks, and ensure that tool execution is handled in a way that minimizes resource contention. [cite: 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]

The application will also need to gracefully handle scenarios where the user's system does not meet the minimum requirements for running certain local LLMs, providing informative feedback and potentially suggesting alternative options. [cite: 178, 179, 180, 181]

### 11.3 Scalability Considerations

While the application's core functionality is local, the server-mediated handling of web LLM API requests will need to be scalable to accommodate a growing user base. [cite: 179, 180, 181]

We will design the server component with scalability in mind, potentially utilizing cloud-based serverless functions or containerized deployments that can be scaled horizontally as needed. [cite: 180, 181]

Similarly, the use of Qdrant for storing and retrieving user data will require consideration of its scalability to ensure efficient performance even with a large number of users and extensive conversation histories. [cite: 181]

## 12. Internationalization Strategy

To reach a global audience, the application will be designed with internationalization in mind. [cite: 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]

### 12.1 Language Support

The application will aim to support multiple languages in its user interface. [cite: 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]

We will investigate methods for detecting the user's preferred language based on their system settings and provide options for manually selecting a language within the application. [cite: 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]

Consideration will also be given to how the application interacts with LLMs in different languages, although the LLM's inherent multilingual capabilities will likely handle much of this aspect. [cite: 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]

### 12.2 Localization of Resources

All user-facing text and UI elements will be managed as translatable resources. [cite: 186, 187, 188, 189]

We will utilize the chosen Rust i18n library to organize and load translations for different languages. [cite: 187, 188, 189]

This will involve creating resource files for each supported language, containing translations for all the application's text. [cite: 188, 189]

The localization process will be designed to be efficient and allow for easy addition of new languages in the future. [cite: 189]

## 13. Conclusion and Next Steps

This product plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for the development of a local and privacy-focused personal assistant application. [cite: 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]

By supporting both local and web LLMs, employing a non-chat memory model, prioritizing user privacy, and embracing open-source principles, this application aims to offer a unique and valuable solution to users seeking greater control over their AI interactions. [cite: 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]

### 13.2 Recommended Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the development team should include:

* Setting up the foundational Rust project structure, incorporating the specified Rust edition and async-std runtime. [cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]
    
* Selecting the initial frameworks for local LLM integration (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio) and web LLM API interaction. [cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]
    
* Prototyping the core functionalities for daily users, such as web search and calculator. [cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]
    
* Implementing the basic structure for the "tools" system and a few initial tools (e.g., a simple file finder). [cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]
    
* Integrating Qdrant for initial experimentation with conversation summarization and retrieval. [cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]
    

A phased development approach is recommended, starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) that includes the core functionalities and gradually adding more complex features like the full "tools" system, advanced power user controls, and comprehensive internationalization support. [cite: 197, 198]

Further research should be conducted in specific areas, such as the optimal Rust GUI and TUI frameworks for our needs and advanced techniques for anonymizing web LLM requests. [cite: 198]
